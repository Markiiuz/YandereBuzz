The worldwide-famous coding exercise "FizzBuzz", done in the worst possible way.

## What is Fizz Buzz?

Fizz Buzz is a math-related word game for children, used to improve basic dividing skills, in which the player or players (it can be played both indivudally and with others) count upwards. The catch is that when they reach a number that is divisible by 3, instead of saying that number, they say "fizz". When the number is divisible by 5, they say "buzz". When the number is both divisible by 3 and 5, they say "fizzbuzz".

Because of its simplicity, recreating this game in code has become a very popular coding exercise, not only between beginners, but between interviewers as well.

Your coding style and structuring say a lot about your skills as a programmer, and it is crucial to work on said skills as much as possible. To test these skills, some interviewers use this basic exercise to test your ability to make simple, easy-to-read and convenient code. It is not hard to complete this exercise, as there are countless ways of approaching it. What is hard, however, is making it as clean and simple as possible.

If you want to know more about the game and/or the importance of clean code, I highly recommend this video: https://youtu.be/QPZ0pIK_wsc

I will also upload my own attempt of doing the FizzBuzz exercise, trying to be as clean as possible (The file is named FizzBuzz.py)

## YandereBuzz

A few days ago a friend showed me a YouTube video in which some friends look into the source code of one of the games of the infamous videogame developer YandereDev (the video in question: https://youtu.be/sXotP-9LcDY). After seeing the atrocious way in which the game was coded (the reason why its optimization was terrible) I became inspired, and decided to try my best replicate its style on a FizzBuzz exercise. What you will see in my code is a rather insightful example of how not to approach the FizzBuzz exercise.

This is a little project by me, made completely for fun. Hopefully I will learn something new, but I would not be surprised if that's not the case at all. Good day!
